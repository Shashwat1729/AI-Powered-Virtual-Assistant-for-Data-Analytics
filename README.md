# AI-Powered Virtual Assistant for Data Analytics

This project allows users to interact with datasets by asking **natural language questions**. The assistant translates these queries into **SQL** and performs data analysis, including generating **visualizations**.

## Features:
- Upload a CSV file for data analysis.
- Ask natural language questions about the data (e.g., "What is the average sales per product?").
- The system generates an SQL query to retrieve data and creates visualizations using **Matplotlib** or **Seaborn**.

## Setup:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shashwat1729/AI-Data-Analytics-Assistant.git
   cd AI-Data-Analytics-Assistant
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Flask app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to upload datasets and ask queries.

## Example Use Case:
- Upload a sales dataset.
- Ask questions like "What are the top 5 products by revenue?" or "What is the correlation between sales and product ratings?"
- Get the SQL query, data result, and a plot visualizing the insights.
